# Characteristics-of-Ultrasonic-Sensor-Smart-Bin-Technology
IoT Based Smart Dustbin using NodeMCU. In this project , we are going to make anÂ IoT based Dustbin. You can check whether the dustbin is full or empty through a webpage. This dustbin updates its status in percentage in every 5 seconds, and when the dustbin is filled more than 70%, it sends an email that your dustbin is almost full.
